# 🔧 Compatibility Fix for Interactive Drawing

## ❌ **The Problem**

You encountered this error:
```
AttributeError: module 'streamlit.elements.image' has no attribute 'image_to_url'
```

This happens because the original `streamlit-drawable-canvas` package uses deprecated Streamlit APIs that were removed in newer versions.

## ✅ **The Solution**

Use the **fixed version** instead:

```bash
# Remove the old version (if installed)
pip uninstall streamlit-drawable-canvas

# Install the fixed version
pip install streamlit-drawable-canvas-fix

# Restart your Streamlit app
streamlit run app.py
```

## 🎯 **What Changed**

| Original Package | Fixed Package |
|------------------|---------------|
| `streamlit-drawable-canvas` | `streamlit-drawable-canvas-fix` |
| ❌ Incompatible with modern Streamlit | ✅ Compatible with all Streamlit versions |
| ❌ `image_to_url` error | ✅ No compatibility errors |
| 📅 Last updated: June 2023 | 📅 Actively maintained |

## 📦 **Import Statement**

The import statement **remains the same**:
```python
from streamlit_drawable_canvas import st_canvas
```

Only the package name changes during installation.

## 🚀 **Ready to Use**

After installing `streamlit-drawable-canvas-fix`, you'll have:
- ✅ **Full interactive drawing** functionality
- ✅ **Rectangle drawing** for planogram sections
- ✅ **Transform tools** for editing sections
- ✅ **Modern Streamlit compatibility**

## 🔄 **Migration Steps**

If you already have the old package installed:

1. **Uninstall old version:**
   ```bash
   pip uninstall streamlit-drawable-canvas
   ```

2. **Install fixed version:**
   ```bash
   pip install streamlit-drawable-canvas-fix
   ```

3. **Restart your app:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

4. **No code changes needed** - imports stay the same!

## ℹ️ **Why This Happened**

- Streamlit evolves and sometimes removes deprecated APIs
- The original `streamlit-drawable-canvas` used `streamlit.elements.image.image_to_url`
- This method was removed in newer Streamlit versions
- The `-fix` version updates the internal code to use current APIs

Now you can enjoy **full interactive drawing** capabilities! 🎨
